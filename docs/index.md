## Summary

A top down dungeon maze game. Users will have to navigate through a maze within the given time per difficulty of level. 
The user can only see up to one space ahead of them and will have to memorize the corridors in order to pass through successfully. 

## Intended users

* People who like challenging puzzles.

  >As someone who likes puzzle games I would love to have a challenging game that requires me to really think about what I am doing and plan ahead with each move. 
  
* People who are casual gamers.

  >As someone who likes to play games, but not on consoles, I would love to have a game that allows me to play when I want, without the pressure of being judged if I am not good enough at the game, and knowing I can go at my own pace.
  
## Functionality

* Users will be set in a grid-like maze and have to move through the maze while only seeing one step ahead at a time with the options of which direction they can go.

* Users will choose the direction of which way their "character" can go by tapping on the "d-pad" to choose an available direction to go.

* There will be levels of difficulty 1-20 that a user can select. The difficulty rating effects the amount of corridors the player may have to go through to find the exit. With each level of difficulty, the player is also allowed more time to get through the level.

* Each time a new maze is rendered, the corridors with be randomly generated. Players can choose to play the same difficulty over and over again but each time they start a new level it will be different.

* If a player runs out of time, they have the option to restart the maze and when doing so, the same maze will re-generate, and the player will have to memorize the paths they chose before to try to get to the end before running out of time.

* Players will have access to a leaderboard that will show ranks of levels beaten and high scores of the fastest times beaten in each difficulty.

## Device/external services

* Google sign in
>Google sign in will be used to track the users accomplishments for leaderboards (Levels beaten, time taken, etc...). Google sign in will also allow users to access their same accounts and stats through multiple devices.

## Stretch goals/possible enhancements

* Add different skins so players can change the look of their character

* Add Facebook log in
